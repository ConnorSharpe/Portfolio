                        After finishing college with an English degree, an aptitude test revealed that
                        my best talents were in analytical reasoning and number pattern recognition.
                        Six months later I graduated from The Tech Academy Software Developer Boot Camp
                        and was hired on as a developer by the dean to rebuild the entire user experience.
                        I still use my degree to make sweet, sweet comments in my code so that anyone who inherits my projects
                        or even, like, hiring managers will be able to understand exactly what's going on regardless of their #skillz.

                    <p>
                        This is the code that I am most proud of as a developer so far. I was tasked with giving the students a navigation menu
                        that had to be detailed enough for the user to quickly know where they are in the course. In the old system, the progress bar
                        was a clickable and took the user to that percentage page number - the user had to either know which precise page number or guess and click with no page title.
                        In the curriculum course blueprints, each course was organized into sections and each section into subsections. The pages - where the course content is - reside in the subsections.
                        I added the unused sections and subsections into the course structure for the nested view model that would fill the nested accordion. Inside the AreaCourseViewModel, I gently placed a list of
                        AreaSectionViewModels:
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/fulls/NavMenu_Course_Model.PNG" alt="Course View Model" />
                    <p>
                        I slapped a list of AreaSubsectionViewModels all up in those sections:
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/fulls/NavMenu_Section_Model.PNG" alt="Section View Model" />
                    <p>
                        And in those subsections I jammed a list of pages
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/fulls/NavMenu_Subsection_Model.PNG" alt="Subsection View Model" />
                    <p>
                        Since this is the lowest tier needed for display, the page view models only contain their titles, number, and subsection information:
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/fulls/NavMenu_Page_Model.PNG" alt="Page View Model" />
                    <p>
                        With my objects completed, I built a method containing nested foreach loops to fill the viewmodels inside each other. Since I need this functionality
                        in several different parts of the project, I made the return type an area course viewmodel. Look, my CourseAccordionMethod:
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/fulls/NavMenu_CourseAccordion_Method.PNG" alt="CourseAccordion Method" />
                    <p>
                        Luckily for me, my boss had already started a working prototype partial view that stows itself outside of the window, so I just manipulated his code
                        to handle my nested View Model. The HTML structure of my accordion mirrors the controller method with nested bootstrap accordions using foreach loops:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Unfortunately my ride, smoothe thus far, encountered a massive hurdle. Operationally, my menu design was flawless - but the runtime was catastrophic:
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/fulls/NavMenu_RuntTime_Bad.PNG" alt="Bad Run Time" />
                    <p>
                        To fill my menu meant running back and forth between the controller and the dB for each part of the course. That many queries slowed the loading of each page
                        to almost 7 seconds. I had to come up with a way to decrease runtime to a manageable level if I ever wanted to see my baby bird take flight.
                        I decided to give cookies a try. Since the course pages rarely change, the output would be the same unless it was edited by the curriculum team. If I could store the
                        result of the menu rendering method on a server-side cookie, then I would only need to actually run the method upon course creation or editing. By adding the OutputCache
                        attribute to the rendering method and adding VaryByParam and courseId + Modified parameters, I was able to store each side menu by course and keep different versions if the modified date changed.
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/fulls/NavMenu_ShowSideBar_Method.PNG" alt="ShowSideBar Method" />
                    <p>
                        When the method is rendered in the layout, some simple razor Linq queries find the correct attributes based on the course that the user is viewing and the last time that the course was modified
                        to return the menu in...
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/fulls/NavMenu_RuntTime_Good.PNG" alt="RunTime Good" />
                    <p>
                        1.39 seconds. I remember how sore my body was the day after I shortened the run time of each page by more than 5 seconds. As soon as my celebratory dance routine came to a phenomenal, cacauphonous end,
                        I got back to work. In order to personalize the menu a little bit more, I wanted to use JavaScript to dynamically inject the menu with the student's current position so that they could jump to the furthest point
                        they they had achieved in their boot camp from anywhere in the system. So I put an empty div id='currentPosition' in the partial view and used this function to populate it:
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/fulls/NavMenu_CurrentPositionButton_JavaScript.PNG" alt="Current Position Menu JavaScript" />
                    <p>
                        To make my menu a little more user-friendly, I wanted to create a marker to show the exact position if the student is accessing their current course.
                        So I made another cookie stored on the user's machine with their current position information like this:
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/fulls/NavMenu_MenuCookie_Instantiation.PNG" alt="Menu Cookie Creation" />
                    <p>
                        Then I use JavaScript to access the cookie, grab the current position information, and hide it in plain sight inside the menu heading:
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/fulls/NavBar_MenuCookie_JavaScript.PNG" alt="Menu Cookie JavaScript" />
                    <p>
                        Rendered it looks like this:
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/fulls/NavMenu_CurrentCourse_Compact.PNG" alt="Nav Menu Heading" />
                    <p>
                        With the heading complete, I am able to tell which course they are in and what page number they have gotten to. With this new level of precision, I am able to generate
                        an arrow, put it on the current page, and disable the page links afterwards to that students will have to access material in order through the next button so they can't skip any content.
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/fulls/NavMenu_PageBlock_JavaScript.PNG" alt="Current Position Icon JavaScript" />
                    <p>
                        And with that, the Nav Menu was fully operational. Server-side cookies enable quick load times while client side cookies inject user-specific information into the saved course menu. Voila!

                    <p>
                        This is how I built the most accurate progress bar that the Tech Academy has ever used. When I was a student, the progress bar only counted the actual course material
                        which leaves between 2-4 weeks (depending on the particular bootcamp) for the mandatory live projects unaccounted for. The old model attempted to tell students how
                        many days ahead/behind they were and then the student had to mentally account for the amount of time missing from the calculation. I was tasked with preserving the
                        days ahead/behind while making the whole process more accurate. All of the courses at the Tech Academy are weighted by the days it takes on average to complete given an assumed
                        8 hour study day. The issue here is that our largest course page-wise, Computer and Technology Basics, contains over 800 pages - but only takes 3 days to complete because
                        it is not coding intensive. While C# and .Net Framework Course contains only 300 pages but takes about two weeks to complete because of the amount of small coding projects contained within.
                        To top it all off, not all boot camps contain the same classes or completion time (between 10-16 weeks full-time). I reorganized the way that bootcamps were stored in the dB. Since 1 course can exist
                        in some or all camps, I created the LMSCourseOrder table. This is just an object to link a course to a bootcamp. A boot camp itself is just the collection of courseOrders with that boot camp id.
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/fulls/ProgressBar_CourseOrder_Model.png" alt="Course Order Model" />
                    <p>
                        To include the previously unincluded 2 week live projects, I created a live Project course containing only the instructions needed to access the team story boards (about 6 pages) and weighted it at 2 weeks.
                        Boot camps with multiple live projects could now reuse the same live project course in different course orders to accommodate the lengthier camps. Next, I had to find the course progress that the student had completed -
                        a simple matter of dividing the page number they were on by the total pages in the course and rounding that number to a percent. Here is my sweet method:
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/fulls/ProgressBar_CourseProgress_Method.PNG" alt="Course Progress Method" />
                    <p>
                        Since performing the Boot Camp progress and ahead/behind message would be very labor intensive for the program to calculate in teh back end, I decided to hand the issue over to JavaScript. When I built
                        the HTML, I only filled the Course Progress bar and left the warning message and camp progress containers empty to be filled as the page loads:
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/fulls/ProgressBar_Container_HTML.PNG" alt="Progress Container HTML" />
                    <p>
                        Then I included that course progress percentage in the View Model for this progress bar:
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/fulls/ProgressBar_OnlyCourse.PNG" alt="Course Progress Bar" />
                    <p>
                        In order to calculate the boot camp progress as accurately as possible, I would need to find the amount of time it takes to complete the already-completed courses added to the days completed of the course
                        they are in the middle of (course days to complete * course progress) all divided by the total time it will take for the student to complete all courses. To calculate where the student should be, I would need to
                        grab the user start date and the weeks they purchased to compare it to the previously calculated Boot Camp progress. I did this by grabbing all those values and putting them into a string separated by commas like this:
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/fulls/ProgressBar_CookieDetails_Method.PNG" alt="Progress Bar Cookie Values" />
                    <p>
                        The results of which have been put into a client-side cookie to be accessed by the JavaScript:
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/fulls/ProgressBar_Cookie_Instantiation.PNG" alt="Progress Bar Cookie Instantiation" />
                    <p>
                        Then I wrote a gigantic JavaScript function - the first part of which accesses the cookie, finds the boot camp progress, and creates the boot camp progress bar HTML elements
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/fulls/ProgressBar_JavaScript1_Camp.png" alt="Camp Progress Bar JavaScript" />
                    <p>
                        In the second part, the function finds where the student should be given where the aforementioned boot camp progress percentage, and the purchased time that the student has to remain in the system to give them an accurate depiction
                        about whether they are on track, ahead, or behind in their studies and create HTML elements that reflect such.
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/fulls/ProgressBar_Javascript2_Warning.png" alt="Warning Message JavaScript" />
                    <p>
                        The system finally has a supremely accurate progress bar that can handle different lengthed boot camps AND different amounts of purchased time. One final task remains. There had been complaints from students who had fallen behind
                        that the message telling them how far behind they were was stressing them out.
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/fulls/ProgressBar_Full_Behind.png" alt="Bad Progress" />
                    <p>
                        I was to give the user an option to display any combination of course progress, camp progress, and days ahead/behind. I did this by adding a boolean for each element
                        to be stored inside the user's current position object. This would give the person the ability to show the elements they want and allow those changes to be saved when a new page loads.
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/fulls/ProgressBar_CurrentBoolean_Model.png" alt="Current Course Booleans" />
                    <p>
                        Then I created void methods for each progress bar component to toggle the boolean dB values at the click of a button:
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/fulls/ProgressBar_UpdateWarning_Method.png" alt="Update Warning Method" />
                    <img src="images/fulls/ProgressBar_UpdateCourse_Method.png" alt="Update Course Method" />
                    <img src="images/fulls/ProgressBar_UpdateCamp_Method.png" alt="Update Camp Method" />
                    <p>
                        And linked those methods to "+"/"-" icons next to the bar containers...
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/fulls/ProgressBar_Container_Html.png" alt="Empty Progress Containers" />
                    <p>
                        With Jquery onclick methods that activate ajax calls to the void controller toggling methods:
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/fulls/ProgressBar_JavaScript_DisplayToggle.png" alt="Bar Display Toggle" />
                    <p>
                        Now each user is able to choose which information they want displayed:
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/fulls/ProgressBar_NoMessage.png" alt="No Message Bar" />
                    <img src="images/fulls/ProgressBar_full_Ahead.png" alt="Full Bar Ahead" />
                    <p>
                        And now everyone is happy!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Sometimes I forget that my work occaisionally too brilliant for people to look at, but since the students have paid to learn I went about constructing a site-wide Dark Mode. The old
                        system had nothing like this in place so I would be building it from scratch. "Bring it on," I whispered as I turned up the volume of my 80's synth music all the way up to 14
                        (business volume - loud but safe). I began by playing around in CSS. I knew that I wanted everything bright to be dark and vice versa, so I searched for a way to invert colors.
                        The search brought me straight to the filter:invert; attribute. I created a CSS class called dark-mode added to the page's 'html' tag where I just inverted the colors and turned the brightness down a little bit.
                        Then it was just a matter of going through the site and picking the elements that didnt need to be inverted (images, videos, notifications) and then re-inverting them back to the original. It looks like this:
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/fulls/DarkMode_Invert_CSS.png" alt="Dark Mode CSS" />
                    <p>
                        which makes the page go from this:
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/fulls/DarkMode_LightPage.png" alt="Light Page" />
                    <p>
                        to this:
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/fulls/DarkMode_DarkPage.png" alt="Dark Page" />
                    <p>
                        Blue and orange, the Tech Academy colors are on opposite sides of the color wheel so inverting makes everything seem cool and edgy - I wish I thought of it,
                        but that's just how it all worked out. Then, in order to give users the choice to have dark mode - and save it from page to page - I added a boolean called DarkMode
                        to the user table and made a void controller method to manipulate it:
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/fulls/DarkMode_CSharp.PNG" alt="Dark Mode Method" />
                    <p>
                        Then my awesome boss told me that he would like a switch to let the user know which mode they were in. I said, "You mean like this, bro?":
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/fulls/DarkMode_Dark_View.png" alt="Dark Switch" />
                    <img src="images/fulls/DarkMode_Light_View.png" alt="Light Switch" />
                    <p>
                        "Yeah, Bro, how'd you do that?" he asked. It was a simple matter of creating layered html objects to make the switch:
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/fulls/DarkMode_Button_HTML.png" alt="Switch HTML" />
                    <p>
                        and then manipulating those element's css to make it appear like a switch with a ball that covers one of two icons and moves back and forth:
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/fulls/DarkMode_Switch_CSS.png" alt="Switch CSS" />
                    <p>
                        followed by some sweet sweet inline JavaScript to apply the class to the html tags if the user has darkmode already saved when the page loads:
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/fulls/DarkMode_PageLoad_JavaScript.png" alt="DarkMode PageLoad" />
                    <p>
                        and a small method to hit the controller DarkMode Method, toggle the dark-mode class, and alter switch position/button text. That, Adam, is how it's done.

                        A common complaint that instructors had in the past was that there was nothing in place to ensure that all of the coding assignments that students submit are passed successfully.
                        Students either need to go to their inbox on their own volition to see if they have any failed submissions OR they need to fail enough assignments to warrant being contacted by the
                        instructors. I needed to place restrictions on further course material while allowing the user to access prior pages (there must be something they didn't understand in order to fail the task).
                        I started out by changing the existing boolean grading attribute to a nullable "bool?" called Passed - this means that the default value went from false to null. If an assignment has a null grade,
                        the instructors know that it has not been graded yet.
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/fulls/DrillLock_Assignment_Model.PNG" alt="Assignment Model" />
                    <p>
                        Then I added a boolean attribute called FailedAssignmentLock to the CurrentCourse object that will become true when an instructor fails an assignment by that student:
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/fulls/DrillLock_CurrentCourse_Model.PNG" alt="Current Course Model" />
                    <p>
                        Students can only further their position by clicking the next button on their current position page. So inside of that Next controller method, I added an If statement
                        that checks if they are trying to advance their position while locked (that way they still have access to revious material in case they need a refresher).
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/fulls/DrillLock_LockIf_Method.PNG" alt="Drill Lock If" />
                    <p>
                        I built a super simple method and view to be shown if the student's parameters fall inside that If statement:
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/fulls/DrillLock_View_Method.PNG" alt="View Method" />
                    <img src="images/fulls/DrillLock_View.PNG" alt="Lock View" />
                    <p>
                        In order to free themselves from the lock, students need to access their inboxes and resubmit any failed drills. This act would change the assignments grade from failed to null - alerting the instructors to
                        re-assess the method. Resubmission hits this block of code which checks the dB to see if there are any other failed assignments by the student, if not then DrillLock = false. Thus they are allowed to continue
                        learning until an instructor fails another assignment:
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/fulls/DrillLock_StudentInbox_Method.PNG" alt="Assignment Unlock" />
                    <p>
                        Even if they haven't completed the assignment to the instructor's standards, when they resubmit, they can continue on in the system until the instructors regrade the assignment with a failure. This
                        was done so that the students won't need to wait around until an instructor verifies the assignment as passing.
                    </p>

                        The problem: students were not responding to material that instructors are postiong in their inboxes. This was happening
                        because there was no way for them to know that the material had been posted. I set about recifiying that. First I altered the
                        Left menu to accept an int as its model, then I changed the controller method to find the count of unviewed and failed assignments by that
                        student:
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/fulls/Notification_ShowLeftbar_Method.PNG" alt="Show Leftbar" />
                    <p>
                        Then I display the count on the inbox button in the HTML:
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/fulls/Notification_InboxButton_HTML.PNG" alt="inbox button html" />
                    <p>
                        Once I have my notification number, I use css to make it look like a red box with a white number inside:
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/fulls/Notification_Css.PNG" alt="Notification CSS" />
                    <img src="images/fulls/Notification_LeftBar_View.PNG" alt="leftbar notification" />
                    <p>
                        Now that I have my notifications displayed correctly, I needed a way to transfer the notifications up to the nav bar when the side
                        menu is closed, so I create another notification via JavaScript and post it onto the left menu icon when if the left menu is not deployed:
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/fulls/Notification_NavBar_JvaScript.PNG" alt="navbar notification JS" />
                    <img src="images/fulls/Notification_NavBar_View.PNG" alt="navbar notification" />
                    <p>
                        The Notifications are working correctly for all pages except the inbox itself, for that I modified the inbox Index Method to grab a count
                        of the type of unviewed material in each inbox tab to display on the tab title:
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/fulls/Notification_InboxIndex_Method.PNG" alt="inbox index" />
                    <p>
                        Which displays like this:
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/fulls/Notification_StudentFailed_View.PNG" />
                    <p>
                        Now the students have a notification system that updated itself everytime they move to a different page on the site.

                    <p>
                        Students were suggesting a better way to get a look at themselves. I had to find a way for users to upload profile pictures. First I went about creating a folder for the
                        pictures to be stored in called "uploaded_user_images" in the existing "images" folder. Since everyone can only have one profile picture, I decideed to name each picture with
                        the user's ID so that a person editing their picture will rewrite the existing file path. I created a simple method to save the picture files in the new folder:
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/fulls/ProfilePic_FileSave_Method.PNG" alt="File Save Method" />
                    <p>
                        Then I place that code inside the already existing method to edit user profile information and created a bootstrap modal to appear when an edit proile button is clicked. The modal has the a form on it that posts the new
                        file to the folder. I wanted the picture to display before it was saved so that the user would know what they were going to look like, so I gave the picture input a JavaScript onclick event that will display the picture.
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/fulls/ProfilePic_EditModal_Html.PNG" alt="Edit Modal HTML" />
                    <img src="images/fulls/ProfilePic_EditModal_JavaScript.PNG" alt="Edit Modal JavaScript" />
                    <p>
                        The rendered modal looks like this:

                    <img src="images/fulls/ProfilePic_EditModal_View.PNG" alt="Edit Modal View" />
                    <p>
                        I really wish I looked that good.
